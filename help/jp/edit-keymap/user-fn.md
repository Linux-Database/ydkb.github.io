# User Functions

These are some enhanced functions for different keyboard that are preset by the firmware.

As shown below, this is the YD60BLE **LEDs & Functions** setting page. The <html><button>Esc</button></html> key waw set as the first user function here. It means it is <html><button>Esc</button></html> with a single click, but if Shift is pressed, it is <html><button>~</button></html>.

<div style="width: 660px">
