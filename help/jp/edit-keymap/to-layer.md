# To Layer

In the setting tab for **Layer**, there are a few function like below.

<div style="width: 700px">

![](/assets/to-layer-01.png?700)
</div>

Their role is to open the layer to be jumped and close other layers.

For example, there are the following steps.
  1. Layer 0 is the default layer and is on. If you use T3 to open layer 3, set a T->2 on layer 3.
  2. After pressing this T->2, layer 2 is opened and layer 3 is closed. The higheset opened layer is 2.

If T2 is used on T3 instead of T->2, layer 2 is turned on, but layer 3 is still on, so the highest opened layer is 3.

So the name is called **To Layer**. It actually performances is that you can jump from one layer to another layer, regardless of the status of all the layers.
