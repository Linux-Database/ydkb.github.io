# Layer Momentary

Similar to the FN of a production keyboard. The actual effect is that the layer is opened when the FN is held down, and the layer is closed when released. This is the most basic layer function.

FN is just a general term for the key function. For the convenience of display, in the firmware of ydkb.io, they are  displayed as L0 to L7, which means momentarily opening layer 0 to 7.

Take 60% as an example. In Layer 0, select a key and set it to L1.

<div style="width: 700px">

</div>

Then switch to Layer 1 and set the keymap for Layer 1. Remember that in Layer 0, the two blue boxed keys are L1.

<div style="width: 700px">

![](/assets/l-layer-02.png?700)
</div>

After setting as shown above, when the keyboard is in the default layer and either one of the blue boxed keys is pressed and held, if you press another key, the keyboard outputs that key set on Layer 1. Just like Fn(here is L1)+1 = F1.

If it is a key that is not set, it is transparent. For example, L1+A, because there is no A key on Layer1, so it is transparent to Layer 0. As a result, L1+A here still outputs A.

L1 is just a simple example. As the keyboard has a total of 8 layers available, so although the 60% keyboard is not large, such as 61 keys, a total of keys can be set to 61x8 = 488.
