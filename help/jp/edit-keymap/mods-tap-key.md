# Mods Tap Key

This function is very similar to **Layer Tap Key**. 

Some discussion : https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41685.0

Click is a key, long press or combined with other keys is mods. The main points are the same as **Layer Tap Key**.

Let me talk about the main points of this function first.
   1. Click the Yes button. The trigger method is different from the normal button. The normal button is triggered when it is pressed, but here it is triggered when it is released.
   2. Press and then press other keys, or press and hold for a certain period of time, it is a modifier key.
   3. If you want to achieve a long press button, then, because press and long press is a modifier key, you need to double-click and keep pressed.


This feature also has a limit: The "key" triggered when clicked must be a regular key, not a modifier key combination such as Shift+A.
  
So the actual use is, one is to pay attention to when it is used as a button, because it takes effect when it is lifted, it feels slightly delayed than other buttons.

Here is an example. In the settings below, this is a regular 60% Poker layout. There is no individual arrow keys, but we can still use the four buttons in the lower right corner as the arrow keys. The original right Shift is set here. **Click is up| Long press is RShift**. However, this arrow up is not suitable for playing games, because it is also explained as in **Layer Tap Key**, in order to achieve long-press operation, you need to double-click and press this key instead of directly pressing and holding.

If it is for gaming, you can set it in layer 1 to be arrow up, and then open layer 1 or set the default layer to 1 when you need playing game.
