# Mods Key

The Mods refer to ctrl shift alt(option) win(command). This function can be used to set a key to act as multiple modifier keys such as ctrl+shift, or mods with a regular key such as win+e, ctrl+shift+s.

The modifier keys are in no order. Shift+Ctrl+Alt is the same as Ctrl+Alt+Shift, which means that the three modifier keys are pressed at the same time.

Select the **Mods Key** from **Choose Action**. Then Select the key and Mods, and click the **Action Apply** button to set your choice to your keymap. As shown below (note that the middle is the key, the right is the mods.)

You can also use the keyboard to quickly set up, but you can only use the few modifier keys on the left. For example, after selecting a key, directly press the left Ctrl+left Win+C of the keyboard, and the key can be set to such a key combination. But note that the shortcut keys of the system or some software itself will be triggered. Those who cannot use this setting, for example, win+D will return to the desktop. This can be another method, which is to hold down the left modifier key, and then left Click the button below from the top of the web page. For example, after selecting a button, hold down the left Ctrl and left Alt, and then click A, you can set the selected button to Ctrl+Alt+A.

The shortcut keys supported in most software are such mods key.
