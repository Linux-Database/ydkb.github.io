# Layer Mods

This function is equivalent to pressing the selected modifier key while momentarily opening the layer.

For example, if you set the original **Left Alt** on layer 0 to **LAlt while momentarily open Layer 7**, as shown below:

<div style="width: 600px">

![](/assets/layer-mods-01.png?600)
</div>

Then at layer 7, the position where the original number is 4 is set to F4. The result of this is that when pressing Alt+4 at layer 0, since layer 7 is momentarily opened at the same time, the actual pressed key is Alt+F4.

<div style="width: 600px">

![](/assets/layer-mods-02.png?600)
</div>

The above examples are just one of the usages. In addition, left shift and right shift can be set to different functions, such as left Shift is normal Shift, then right Shift is Layer Mods.
