# Layer Tap Toggle

In ydkb.io, this function is displayed as LT. Usually the effect is the same as Layer Momentary, but if it is clicked multiple times (the number of times is defined by the firmware), its function is the same as Layer Toggle.

As long as you understand Layer Momentary and Layer Toggle, this is easy to understand. It is equal to combining two functions onto one key.

For example, if a key is set to LT1, then when the button is held down, it is to momentarily open layer 1, and press it continuously several times, it is toggle layer 1 on or off.
