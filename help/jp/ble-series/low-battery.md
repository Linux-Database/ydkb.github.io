## Low Battery Alert

Most BLE series support this function and no setting is needed. It is enabled by default. When the battery is low, the keyboard's backlight and RGB will be turned off and cannot be turned on. One or more lights on the keyboard will flash, indicating low battery status. Connecting to USB to charge will exit the low battery alert mode.

<subtitle>Some key points:</subtitle>

  -The keyboard only detects the low battery by detecting the voltage when the keyboard is not turned on or when it enters the power-saving mode.
  -In general,  when the low battery alert starts, the keyboard can still be used for a few days without light. But  it is recommended to charge as soon as possible.
  -Sometimes it may jump back to no indiction (voltage fluctuation) after entering the low battery mode.
