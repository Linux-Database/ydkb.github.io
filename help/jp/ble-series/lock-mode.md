# Lock Mode 

In the **LEDs and Functions**, you can find the following button.

<html><button style=" text-align: center; line-height: 19px; width: 46px; height: 42px; font-size:12px">Lock<br>Mode</button></html>

Set it to your keymap. After pressing this key, the keyboard immediately turns off Bluetooth and enters the deep power-saving mode. by only pressing F and J at the same time, or re-plugging the USB cable, or turning the power on and off again can wake the keyboard up. It is desinged for putting in the bag without turning off the switch.

Note: The F and J referred to here refer to the positions of F and J in the default settings. They are fixed and cannot be changed at present.

For some keyboards like HHKB BLE/BLE660C/BLE980C, pressing and holding F and J for a few seconds is needed to wake up the keyboard.
