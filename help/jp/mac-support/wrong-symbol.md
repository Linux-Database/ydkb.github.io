# The key symbol does not correspond

A few people have encountered this problem, so I will explain it separately here.

The system recognizes Shift plus a certain key, and what symbol to output is not determined by the keyboard, but by the system keyboard language. Under Mac, each keyboard is set to language separately. In the same keyboard, in wired mode and Bluetooth mode, the system also considers two different keyboards.

So some people have encountered a problem. The symbols correspond in wired mode, but not in Bluetooth mode.


## Solution

Reset the keyboard language. First in **"Settings-Keyboard"**, select **"Change keyboard type"**.

<div style="width: 600px">

</div>

Then there will be key prompts. The default method of Mac is to determine your keyboard language according to the keys next to Left Shift and Right Shift. However, as a customized keyboard, the keys set by each are relatively free and not so standard, so the Mac default may not be able to correctly recognize the keyboard language.

In fact, don't care about it, just press a few keys randomly and press a few more times on the keyboard you want to set up, it will prompt you that it cannot be recognized. Then manually select the keyboard language as **"ANSI (United States or other countries and regions)"**.
