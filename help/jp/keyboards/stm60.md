For the first attempt of non-AVR series MCUs, this PCB is cost-effective and currently only supports wired mode.

The PCB supports a variety of configurations and is consistent with YD60BLE in this regard.

There is also a derivative version, Ver.B is a full 1u version, only three of the screw positions on the GH60 housing can be used, others need to add screw posts or not. There is also Ver.C.
