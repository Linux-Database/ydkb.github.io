## Attention

If you want to use regular spacebar (6.25U), pay attention to the screw that mount on the plate where close to the spacebar, strongly suggest that use the thin-hear screws in the pack attached, otherwise will affect installation of the spacebar stabilizer.

If you use PCB-mount switches, you’ll need to clip the legs of the switch next to the battery


## Warning

Use computer usb port or licensed charger to charge the battery, all consequences of improper use will be borne by users themselves.
