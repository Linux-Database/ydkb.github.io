# Launch shortcut 

The Mac system itself supports global shortcut keys, so you don't need to look at this. 

This feature is only for windows. The principle is:

After entering a command through win+R, windows first finds the corresponding program or shortcut from the path added in the environment variable, and then runs it. You can google "win+r shortcut" for more details.

Add your path here:

<div style="width: 600px">

![](/assets/shortcut1.png?600)
</div>

ydkb.io supports shortcuts named from 00 to 99, a total number of 100. Put your shortcut in the folder under the environment variable path (you can add one yourself), as shown below.

<div style="width: 600px">

![](/assets/shortcut2.png?600)
</div>

Set the right function key on the keyboard with the same number as your shortcut on the PC.

<div style="width: 600px">

![](/assets/shortcut3.png?600)
</div>

Shortcuts are not limited to applications. Many things can create shortcuts, such as opening a file quickly, opening a URL, running a program in parameters, and so on.
