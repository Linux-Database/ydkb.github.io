# Monochrome backlight

There are two kinds of monochrome backlight for YDKB keyboards.

  - Most customized keyboards do not pursue fancy lighting effects, so most of them just have a backlight, and the monochromatic backlight with unified control is the majority.
  - Only the keyboards with per-switch controlled backlight can support a variety of lighting effects, which requires hardware support.

## Control Method

No matter what kind of the monochrome backlight it is, the control method is the same.

From **LEDs & Functions**, select the following function to control the backlight. The function of each button will be explained when the mouse is pointed.

A total of four backlight control keys, from left to right
  1. Backlight switch
  2. Backlight mode stepping (move to next until the last, then move to the first)
  3. Backlight mode previous
  4. Backlight mode next

You don't need to set all settings. The step is actually equal to the backlight mode plus, and then when the last one is added, press the step again to return to the original.


## Effects for all controlled together backlight

Most keyboards with all controlled together backlight have effects as follows:

| --- ||
|1-3|Three-level brightness|
|4-6|Three-speed breathing|
|7|The faster you type, the brighter the backlight is|
|8|The faster you play, the darker the backlight is|
